# Delete toodos
Delete a todo is very simple. We just have to pass the **TableName** and **Key** as the parameters to the `docClient.delete(params)` method. Let's add a `deleteTodo` function.
```ts showLineNumbers
const deleteTodo = async (id: string) => {
  const params: DocumentClient.DeleteItemInput = {
    TableName: tableName,
    Key: { id }
  }

  return docClient.delete(params).promise();
}
```

## Api gateway handler
Now add an API gateway handler `deleteTodoHandler` for our `deleteTodo` function.
```ts showLineNumbers
export const deleteTodoHandler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> => {
  console.log("patchTodoHandler", event);
  let response: APIGatewayProxyResult;
  try {
    const deleteResult = await deleteTodo(event.pathParameters?.id || '');
    response = jsonResponse(200, deleteResult);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    response = {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: 'some error happened',
      }),
    };
  }
  return response;
};
```

We are extraction the **id** of todo from `event.pathParameters?.id` and passing it to `deleteTodo` function for deleting our todo.

## Sam template configuration
Add below lines of code in `templat.yaml`` file under **Resources** section.

```yaml showLineNumbers
DeleteTodoByIdFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    CodeUri: dist/
    Handler: app.deleteTodoHandler
    Policies:
      - DynamoDBCrudPolicy:
          TableName: !Ref TodoTable
    Environment:
      Variables:
        TODO_TABLE: !Ref TodoTable
    Events:
      UpdateTodo:
        Type: Api
        Properties:
          Path: /todos/{id}
          Method: DELETE
```

Here we are adding an api event with **DELETE** http method to our function resource.

## Test
Build and deploy your application. You will see our lambda functions are being created. After the deployment is completed, you can delete any todos by calling the HTTP **DELETE** method and passing **id** as the path parameter and check if the application is working as expected or not.

:::info Tip
A complete implementation of this todo app can be found [here](https://github.com/VinitTomar/todo-aws-sam). This repository code is restructured and some things might be different from our tutorial.
