There are two ways we can access DynamoDB. Either you can use as amazon web service or you can setup in you local system. For both ways you should provide configure AWS credentials first. In case of local system setup, there is no need for credentials to be correct, you can use and random values. However for web services credentials should be correct.

If you want to save some money I would suggest to setup dynamodb [locally](#local-setup).

## As a web service

If you have AWS cli installed you can run below command to configure you credentials. You need to enter `Access key ID` & `Secret access key` which you can get from aws IAM console.

<AWSConfigure />

To check if you are able to create a table run below command and wait for few seconds.

```bash
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name DummyTable \
    --attribute-definitions \
        AttributeName=Id,AttributeType=N \
    --key-schema \
        AttributeName=Id,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput \
        ReadCapacityUnits=10,WriteCapacityUnits=5
```

Go to DynamoDB service in your aws console. Check if the table is available or not. Or you can run below command to check if table is available.

```bash
aws dynamodb wait table-exists --table-name DummyTable
```

Now you are ready to use AWS dynamodb service.

## Local setup

### JRE

To run dynamodb locally JRE(Java runtime environment) 8.x is required. If you are using Linux or Mac then most probablly java is already available on you system.

You can check if JRE is available by running:

```bash
java -version
```

You should get output like this

```
openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2, mixed mode)
```

If java is not installed, you can download it from here https://www.java.com/en/download/.

### DynamoDB

1. Download dynamodb https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dynamodb-local-mumbai/dynamodb_local_latest.zip.
2. Extract content from zip file. Content for the zip should look like this.
>![dynamodb-zip-content](../imgs/local-dynamo-db.png)
3. Go inside the directory where you have extracted dynamodb zip file.
5. Run this command to start dynamodb instance.
>```bash
>java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
>```
6. Run `aws configure` and enter fake credentials.
7. Run this command to check if dynamodb is working. Make sure if port 8000 is available.
>```bash
>aws dynamodb create-table \
>    --table-name DummyTable \
>    --attribute-definitions \
>        AttributeName=Id,AttributeType=N \
>    --key-schema \
>        AttributeName=Id,KeyType=HASH \
>    --provisioned-throughput \
>        ReadCapacityUnits=10,WriteCapacityUnits=5 \
>    --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
>```
8. Check if table is created or not.
>```bash
>aws dynamodb wait table-exists --table-name DummyTable --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
>```

If every things goes fine as per above step then you are ready to use dynamodb locally.

### DynamoDB-Admin

If you want a GUI to manage your db like you do with AWS console, then you can use `dynamodb-admin`.

If you have nodejs in you system, as you should because we are going to use typescript for our examples, then you can use this command to install `dyanmodb-admin` globally.
```bash
npm install -g dynamodb-admin
```

Run command `dynamodb-admin` in terminal and then open `http://localhost:8001` in browser.
Now you GUI is also available for managing dynamodb.
